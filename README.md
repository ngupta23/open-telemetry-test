# open_telemetry_test
A template for initializing a python repository managed with `uv`

## üõ†Ô∏è Create the Development Environment & üîß Install Pre-commit Hooks

* Pre-commit hooks help maintain code quality by running checks before commits.
* Update the .pre-commit-config.yaml if needed, then run the following command
  * `make devenv`
  * This will do both of these steps - create the dev env and install pre-commit.

```bash
# Install uv
pip install uv

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate

# # Initialize uv. NOTE: The following may not have an impact since we are already
# # adding a custom project.toml to this repository
# uv init

make devenv
```

## üîÑ Update Dependencies

If you want to add or update dependencies, you can do so using the `uv` command. This will update the `pyproject.toml` file and the lock file.

```bash
# Update dependencies for production
uv add <prod_lib>

# To add to dev dependency group
# https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#development-dependencies
uv add --dev <dev_lib>

# update the lock file
uv lock
```

## üèÉ Run tests

* pytest settings are in the `pyproject.toml` file so everything does not need to be specified in the command line.
* The tests are split and run in parallel to speed up the CI.
* Some tests can be flaky, for example when doing live testing with other systems without mocking. This issue can be overcome with the rerun option which is also enabled.
* Make sure that the tests are passing and that they pass the coverage requirement.

```bash
# to run all tests
uv run pytest

# to run specific splits of the tests (mostly useful for CI, not standalone).
make split-tests SPLITS=4 GROUP=2
```
